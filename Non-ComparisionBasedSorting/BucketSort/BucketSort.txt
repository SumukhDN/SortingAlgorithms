#BUCKET-SORT
->Bucket sort is a sorting technique that involves dividing elements into various groups, or buckets. These buckets are formed by 
  uniformly distributing the elements. Once the elements are divided into buckets, they can be sorted using any other sorting algorithm. 
  Finally, the sorted elements are gathered together in an ordered fashion.

#BUCKET-SORT-ALGORITHM
Create n empty buckets (Or lists) and do the following for every array element arr[i].

->Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
->Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
->Concatenate all sorted buckets.

#SPACE-COMPLEXITY --> O(n+k)
