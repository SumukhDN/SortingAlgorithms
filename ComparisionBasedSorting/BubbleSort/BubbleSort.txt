#ADVANTAGES-of-Bubble-Sort:
->Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
->It does not require any additional memory space.
->It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.



#DISADVANTAGES-of-Bubble-Sort:
->Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.
->It requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.



#CONCLUSION
->Bubble sorts are a good option for smaller lists,without many variables.
->They are simple to understand, and easy to write code for, but are slow to sort the list.
