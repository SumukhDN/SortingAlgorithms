#BUBBLE-SORT
->Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
->This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.


#Time-Complexity: 

BestCase              AverageCase              WorstCase
 O(N)                   O(N^2)                    O(N^2)


#Space-Complexity-->  O(1)


#ADVANTAGES:
->Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.
->It does not require any additional memory space.
->It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.



#DISADVANTAGES:
->Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.
->It requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases.



#CONCLUSION:
->Good option for smaller lists,without many variables.
->They are simple to understand, and easy to write code.
->Slow to sort the list.
->Stable
