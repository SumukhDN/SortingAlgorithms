#INSERTION-SORT
->Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
->The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
->Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

#SPACE-COMPLEXITY  -> O(1)



#CHARACTERISTICS
->The Insertion Sort algorithm follows an incremental approach.
->Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm.
->Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
->It is Adaptive in nature i.e., well used for partially sorted input data sets.
->Takes O(N^2) when sorting in the reverse order.



#CONCLUSION
->Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. 
->It can also be useful when the input array is almost sorted, and only a few elements are misplaced in a complete big array.
->In-Place.
->Stable.
